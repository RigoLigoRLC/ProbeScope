# ProbeScope

Real time variable acquisition, data plotting, RTT terminal, etc via debug probe (ST-Link, CMSIS DAP Link).

This project started as a side-project when I was participating in RoboMaster competition, and it gradually evolved into my undergraduate dissertation. As a result, please expect poor code quality. ðŸ™‚
